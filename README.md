# Foodful

Spawned as a final project for UIUC's CS498RK: The Art of Web Programming, Foodful is a simple platform that connects restaurants and businesses to food banks and charities. The backend can be found at https://github.com/ygong10/foodful_api and the design at https://www.behance.net/gallery/47532461/Foodful on behance.

* Food waste accounts for a loss of about $165 billion per year, an estimated $40 billion of which comes from household waste
* A mere 15% decrease in food waste would result in enough food to feed 25,000,000 Americans
* In 2010, America wasted 33.79 million lbs of food - enough to fill the Empire State Building 91 times

## Our Purpose

In an effort to drastically reduce food waste in America while simultaneously feeding the needy, Foodful connects restaurants with nearby food banks and charities so that they may donate any leftover food at the end of the day.
